# Learning Erlang

[Erlang Modules](http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/modules.html)
: Sites in Lambda Pad are defined by a single Erlang module named `index`. This
  link will teach you all about modules.

[Erlang Term Syntax](http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/data_types.html)
: As `index.erl` is an Erlang module made up of Erlang terms, you'll need to
  know this to get very far.

[Erlang Functions](http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/functions.html)
: Custom filers are implemented as Erlang functions --- this will help you on
  that front.
